# Web Select

> Copy tables and formatted content with web select

> Web select makes copying content much easier than highlighting with your cursor. Web select opens a selection window that lets you easily select and copy tables or parts of tables, without the parts you don't want. To open web select, right-click on the web page and select web capture from the context menu and then choose web select or press Ctrl+Shift+X on your keyboard.
